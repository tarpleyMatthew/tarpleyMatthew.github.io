               <p> “My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his
               →lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the
               →mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really
               →mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand,
               →hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things
               →which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes,
               →the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most
               →outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen
               →conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”</p>
